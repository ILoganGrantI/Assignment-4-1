Believing in Pixar`s potential, Jobs initially invested $50 million of his own money in the company” (Biography.com). While it was initially just a computer graphics group, he launched Pixar with John Lasseter in 1986 (Fekete). Lesseter said about Jobs that “[h]e went through an arc in his life. There was a time the way he worked with people was not good, and I saw that when I first worked with him. But peo­ple look at that dramatic part, and they’ll make a movie about that — and that’s not the story. That was the beginning of a more interesting and complex story because when he left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic hero’s journey: He’s wandering in the wilderness, he’s working with NeXT, it’s not working. He’s working with Pixar, we’re failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person” (Fekete). Together they made the “first fully computer-animated feature film”(Wikepedia) Toy Story in 1995.</p>'
